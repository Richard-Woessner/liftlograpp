# App im making in ReactJS to log my lifts, because notebooks are annoying.

### Goals / ToDo
- [x] Track weight, reps and sets of a lift
- [x] Allow for me to add a failure option
- [ ] Have an in app calendar so I can go back and review lifts from months prior
- [ ] Every lift should have a notes option so you can describe the lift if need be
- [x] Be able to add lifts so you're not only tracking the typical Bench, Deadlift and Squat
- [x] Remember said added lifts and will add it to the users "available lifts"
- [ ] Have a handy 1RM calculator handy
- [ ] The ability to export lifts history in a excel sheet
- [ ] Clean Code
